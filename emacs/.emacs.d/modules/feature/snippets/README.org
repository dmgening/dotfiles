There are no extra dependencies for this module.

By default, this module uses the snippet library included with yasnippet.

For the best experience, I'd suggest installing mine from https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-snippets -- they have been tailored specifically for Doom.

1. Clone the repo to your private module:
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   git clone https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-snippets ~/.emacs.d/modules/private/$(whoami)/snippets
   #+END_SRC
2. Tell yasnippet where to look for them:
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   ;; modules/private/{USERNAME}/config.el
   (after! yasnippet
     (setq yas-snippet-dirs
           (append (list (expand-file-name "snippets/" (file-name-directory load-file-name)))
                   (delq 'yas-installed-snippets-dir yas-snippet-dirs))))
   #+END_SRC
