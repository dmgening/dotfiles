Certain languages may require additional setup, and some languages may have no completion support at all.

Check the README.org in that language's module for details.

* Configure
** Auto-completion
By default, I've disabled auto-completion. This is my preference. I prefer to invoke company when I need it by calling ~company-complete~ manually (typically, bound to =C-SPC= in insert mode). However, some may not share my preference.

To enable auto-completion you must:

1. Load ~company~,
2. and change ~company-idle-delay~ to a non-nil float (the default is 0.5)

For example, add the following to your ~modules/private/<username>/config.el~ module:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'company)
(setq company-idle-delay 0.2
      company-minimum-prefix-length 3)
#+END_SRC

* Troubleshooting
If completion isn't working for you, please consider the following before posting a bug report:

+ If what you are expecting is popup-as-you-type completion (which is disabled by default), see the "Customize" section above; it includes instructions on how to enable this.
+ Certain languages may have extra dependencies in order for auto-completion to work. Please look for that module's README.org for details.
+ Some languages don't have any auto-completion support.
